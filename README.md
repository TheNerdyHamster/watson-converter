# Watson importer

## Information
This project was based on a human misstake, after trying to move over the `watson` frame file, to a new device it diden't show up. Instead of looking for parameters, I thought I would solve it with help of recreating the frames, but that diden't help either.
So now you may ask, "How did you solve it?".
If you write `watson log -a` all your logged frames with show up, I realised that after I got a working application.


## What did I learn?
During one hour of development time, I did learn how to use flags and execute system commands with `Golang`.
